Managed to get the form to go the dashboard page once the user entered admin and password, now the dashboard just needs to be properly be implemented.

Week of 2023-02-20 (READING WEEK)

Continued to work admin page, modified the login keys, and worked on teh query that will be used to display all the images and associated columns for the data that is needed.

Week of 2023-02-27

Worked on the filtors for acending and decending for the images, got them to store into cookies so they could properly work.

Week of 2023-03-06

Worked on being able to search for specifc countries, cities, and ratings, also worked on being able to change the ratings and have it update the table accordingly when the rating is submitted. During this process, the log out button was also worked on, allowing the user to log out. Still need to figure out how to have the cookies to properly store when the user logs back in, and have that cookie last 24 hours.

Week of 2023-03-13

Worked on the API for ddrop.php and have it reflect the proper JSON accordingly, did this by adding the query to the query helpers as well as, refering to tutorial 6? Whichever one was the one where 
we fooled around the API's. So far, it spits out all everything where the rating is 3 and the user id is 23. There's 24 deaddrops i guess? When a city code is entered, it will show the number of drops, so the $_GET is working with the query string.

Password hashing is also somewhat completed. Now its time to start on the JSCRIPT stuff, which will be interesting to see...
