Week of 2023-01-09


I had a nice date with nate...dude warms my soul. And man, what a friend I have in Viktoria. She's awesome. If it weren't for last weekened though maybe I'd have more of a login page to actually work with...shucks.

Web 2 is goddamn intimidating but im confidant ill succeed. I really like there. I started looking at differnet frameworks that could be used and got a basic login page working with colors and CSS.

Poor vik seems to be having a rough time....too bad it sucks when you see people in need of help, but all you can do is listen and be there on the sidelines...also DAMN, Nate's in a mood too? This is why relationships suck...


Continued to work on the login page, made sure the form was properly working, assigned a method to the associated form.

Damn, these robotic competitions on the weekends really take up my time, it's nice to know that these kids look up to me. Shout out to NEO Robotics and running a team filled with energetic children that never cease to stop....

Managed to get the form to go the dashboard page once the user entered admin and password, now the dashboard just needs to be properly be implemented.

Oh gosh, im now in girl drama....what do you do when two of your good friends whom you love dearly are now fighting with each other??? You dont wanna take sides but asjdfasfsfdadfdsf.....deep breathes, just do the best i can...i guess??? I hope vik and michelle dont hate me by the end of this...

Continued to work on the base form for the browsefilter page. Added the proper php files for the admin and the browsefilter pages. 

Week of 2023-02-06

Aw man...i guess people prefer ignorance, it do be blissful. I really have to shut my blabber mouth sometimes...perhaps that would be better...perhaps....uhghgh

Fixed the issue where if the user goes to the browsefilterpage without logging in, the user is redirected to the admin page.

Damn...vik is ignoring me now. that kind of stings...at least Nate seems to not be so moody anymore.

Did not work on the project this week...busy with other courses :/...and drama.

Week of 2023-02-20 (READING WEEK)

I tried addressing what vik was upset about...yeah...that did NOT help at all...also apparently im too depressed to be around according to nate. Wowza....maybe i gotta learn to stop dumping and keep shit to myself.

Continued to work admin page, modified the login keys, and worked on the query that will be used to display all the images and associated columns for the data that is needed.

Week of 2023-02-27

Vik seems to be uh....better with me now? perhaps its not worth bringing up all the dumb angst and drama.

Worked on the filtors for acending and decending for the images, got them to store into cookies so they could properly work.

Week of 2023-03-06

Nate and I had a talk...looks like hes sort of peeved that I don't follow his big boy advice on stuff. And now has distanced himself...man...why can't deepness with people last.... :_;

Worked on being able to search for specifc countries, cities, and ratings, also worked on being able to change the ratings and have it update the table accordingly when the rating is submitted. During this process, the log out button was also worked on, allowing the user to log out. Still need to figure out how to have the cookies to properly store when the user logs back in, and have that cookie last 24 hours.

RED DEER TRIP!!! WOOO!!! THE KIDS MADE IT TO PROVINCIALS!! BY THE POWER OF MENTORING I AM (SOMEHOW?) A MENTOR TO THESE FELLOW CHILDREN!!! SHOUT OUT AC ROBOTICS!!!!

Worked on the API for ddrop.php and have it reflect the proper JSON accordingly, did this by adding the query to the query helpers as well as, refering to tutorial 6? Whichever one was the one where 
we fooled around the API's. So far, it spits out all everything where the rating is 3 and the user id is 23. There's 24 deaddrops i guess? When a city code is entered, it will show the number of drops, so the $_GET is working with the query string.

Password hashing is also somewhat completed. Now its time to start on the JSCRIPT stuff, which will be interesting to see...

Week of 2023-03-20

I'm uhhh...yeah..i need to be away from people right now. Too much distractions. and if im around nate and vik, i think ill just feel bad. Give it time, ill be around them when im ready....

There is now a div that displays a simple array I made in javacript. Now I need to figure out how to get the json object to return the assorted country names.

All these git commits keep reminding me of the commitments people have made only to never fall up on them.... ;_

Each line of code that I write give a tiny little rush of dopamine, which is a nice distraction from the pain I currently feel. I have no idea what grade I will get on this project, all I know is that java script is facinating while mind numingly frustrating. Also, this just occured to me, but how the FUCK did zuckerberg built FB to what it was strictly through PHP??? What a mad lad. 

There's still a lot to do, i was able to get a good amount done on the default view side. First I got to make sure im pulling the right cities...the big man JP says im not doing that right...hiyah....
